Cover: 

- Phase I (Getting Basic Supplies Building)
-- Building
--- Add Medium Cargo Container to Survival kit on Starter Ship
--- Getting Large Grid Setup
---- Place (ideally) 3x3 NON-WELDED base of Light Armor blocks
---- Build tower of at least 6 tall 1x1 light armor
---- Create "Compass Spokes" (NSEW) blocks, and a final/top block
---- Build Wind Turbine on top
---- Build Basic Assembler 
-- Production (Survival Kit)
--- 1K Gravel
--- Medium Cargo Container (i.e., the parts neeed for)
--- Add Wind Turbine Container
--- Add Basic Assembler
-- Progression (Grind, then repair)
--- Landing Gear
--- H2/O2 Generator
--- Small Hydrogen Tank (temporary is ok -- to enable H2 Thrusters)
--- Small Cargo Container
---- Conveyor
-- Tasks
--- Collect STONE in between activities above to keep production going
--- ONCE the medium cargo can be built: fill it until it is full (~10K); then again when it runs out
--- Equipment: Grab H2 Tank from H2/O2 Generator

- Phase II (Merging Start Ship with Base)
-- Note: ENSURE Survival Kit ONLY produces gravel!
-- Building
--- Build Small Cargo on to Assembler
--- Build Advanced Rotor on to Small Cargo
---- REMOVE the head
---- Add a Small Head to the cargo
--- Attach Sm Grid Conveyor Junction to Adv Rotor
--- Interior Wall
-- Production
--- Lg Grid Small Cargo
--- Lg Grid Adv. Rotor
--- Sm Grid Conveyor Junction (NOT a small conveyor!)
--- Lg Grid Turbine x2
--- Interior Wall
--- Medium Cargo Container x2
--- Large Grid Battery
--- 1K Gravel (Survival Kit)
-- Tasks
--- Grind down needed Thrusters (4 atmo + 1 h2) for Metal Grids (for Small Cargo)
--- Keep filling stone into small grid Survial Kit (~10K in med cargo)
--- Ensure Production is completed thru LARGE grid Assembler
---- Manually move over ingots to the Assembler
--- BEFORE the battery is produced/built -- move Survival Kit to Large Grid
--- Grind down Survial Kit ONLY after all parts for the Adv. Rotor are acquired
-- Progression
--- Interior Wall (on Base)
---- Interior Light (on Starter Ship)
--- Battery
---- Beacon
----- Antenna

- Phase III (Static Drill Setup -- Assume Large Grid)
-- Production
--- Basic Refinery
--- Drill x1
--- Conveyors x 8
--- Advanced Rotor
--- Piston 
--- Drill x 6
-- Building
--- Extend conveyors out for static drilling
--- Recommend Horizontal Drilling IF no jetpacks
--- 
-- Progression
--- You sould build the Basic Refinery and tear it down for the first Drill
---- Drills NEED a refinery
---- However, the Survial Kit is better or equal to the Basic Refinery for Stone

- Phase IV (Final Progression before Cobalt)
-- Production
--- Small Grid Rocket Launcher
--- Small Grid Sound Block
--- Small Grid Door
--- Refinery (Less the Grids)
--- Assembler (Less the Grids)
--- Large Cargo Container (Less the Grids)
-- Building
--- On the Small Grid attached to the base
---- Rocket Launcher
---- Sound Block
---- Door 

- Phase V (Cobalt)
-- Build
--- Assembler
--- Refinery
--- Large Cargo Container
-- Production 
--- Assembler, Refinery, Large Cargo Grids
--- Equipment: Enhanced Drill, Enhanced Grinder, Enhanced Welder
