Static Drill Strategy
=====================

The detailed phases provide a starting strategy for a new game, or new base, in Space Engineers.
It is designed to incorporate unlocking the basic blocks and progression of the game.
This strategy is uses a Static Drilling rig setup in Phases.
Each phase addresses Production, Building, Progression, and Tasks.

Phase I - Getting Basic Supplies Building 
-----------------------------------------

- Production (Survival Kit) (i.e., start producing the parts needed for blocks)
-- Medium Cargo Container 
-- Add Wind Turbine
-- Add Basic Assembler
-- 1K Gravel
- Building
-- Attach Medium Cargo to the Starter Ship's Survival Kit
--- Advanced tactic: drill immediately under the edge of where the cargo will be placed
--- If the landing gear is off, then when filled with stone the ship will tilt down
--- This enables quicker drilling, and "looking up" to fill the cargo/Survial Kit 
-- Prepare a new base with a Large Grid setup
--- Place (ideally) 3x3 NON-WELDED base of Light Armor blocks
--- Build tower of at least 6 tall 1x1 light armor
---- Note that pillars should be 8 blocks apart
---- Or have 5 blocks, blade-to-blade, between pillars' Turbine blades
---- Create "Compass Spokes" (NSEW) blocks, and a final/top block
---- Build the single Wind Turbine on top (until Phase II)
--- Build Basic Assembler 
- Progression (Grind, then repair IF blocks are on starter ship)
-- Landing Gear
-- H2/O2 Generator
--- (ADD temporary) Small Hydrogen Tank
---- To unlock H2 Thrusters; use an atmospheric thruster for parts
---- AVOID hooking it into the conveyor system, to save ice
-- Small Cargo Container
--- Conveyor
- Tasks
-- Start with filling the Survival Kit with stone, until you cannot -- then focus on adding the Medium Cargo
-- Mine STONE inbetween building/progression activities above
-- After medium cargo is built: fill it full (~10K)
--- Then again when it runs out
--- This "should" be enough to cover thru Phase II
-- Equipment: Grab H2 Tank from H2/O2 Generator IF jetpack is enabled, and O2 bottle IF in non-O2 start
-- Gather "Unknown Signal" air drops no greater than 1.5Km (on foot), 3.5(with jetpack)
--- run with drill equipped to detect ore
--- Motivation: upgraded tools can be found, and spare parts can be found and/or grinded
--- ENSURE stone is filled before departing!

Phase II - Merging Start Ship with Base
---------------------------------------

Note: ENSURE Survival Kit ONLY produces gravel from here on out!

- Production
-- Large Grid Small Cargo
--- MOVE the small tubes to the FRONT of production queue
-- Large Grid Advanced Rotor
-- Small Grid Conveyor Junction (NOT a small conveyor!)
-- Wind Turbine x2
-- Medium Cargo Container x2
-- Large Grid Battery
-- Interior Wall
-- 10K Gravel (Survival Kit)
- Building
-- Large Grid, Small Cargo on to Basic Assembler
-- Advanced Rotor on to Small Cargo
--- REMOVE the large grid Rotor Head
--- Add a "Small Head" to the cargo (via control menus)
-- Attach Small Grid Conveyor Junction to Advanced Rotor
-- Interior Wall (to unlock lights)
- Progression
-- Interior Wall (on Base)
--- Interior Light (on Starter Ship)
-- Battery
--- Beacon
---- Antenna
- Tasks
-- Grind down needed Thrusters (4 atmo + 1 h2) for Metal Grids (for Small Cargo)
-- Keep filling stone into small grid Survial Kit (~10K in med cargo)
-- Ensure Production is completed thru the base's Basic Assembler
--- Manually move over ingots from the Survival Kit to the Assembler
-- BEFORE the battery is produced/built: move Survival Kit to Large Grid
--- Production of the 80 Power Cells takes a long time
--- The Large Grid Survival Kit only costs 29 more steel plates than the Small Grid
--- The Advanced Rotor, with a Small Head, allows all the parts from the Starter Ship to be built 1:1 on the base
--- This saves signigicant time and resources at the start of a new game

Phase III - Static Drill Setup
------------------------------

Note: Assume Large Grid blocks for building.

- Production
-- Basic Refinery x2 (to start Drill production for steel plates)
-- Drill x1
-- Conveyors x 8
-- Advanced Rotor
-- Piston 
-- Drill x 5*
- Building
-- Extend conveyors out for static drilling
-- Recommend Horizontal Drilling IF no jetpacks
--- *Two main methods: (1) Piston + Hinge sweeping or (2) Piston + Rotor spinning 
---- Rotor spinning can be 7-wide
---- Hinge sweeping can be 7-wide, but 5/6-wide is more stable
- Progression
-- You sould build the Basic Refinery and tear it down for the first Drill
--- Drills NEED a refinery
--- However, the Survial Kit is better or equal to the Basic Refinery for Stone
- Tasks

Phase IV - Final Progression before Cobalt
-------------------------------------------

- Production
-- Small Grid Rocket Launcher
-- Small Grid Sound Block
-- Small Grid Door
-- Refinery (Less the Grids)
-- Assembler (Less the Grids)
-- Large Cargo Container (Less the Grids)
- Building
-- On the Small Grid attached to the base
--- Rocket Launcher
--- Sound Block
--- Door 

Phase V - Post-Cobalt Processing Progression
-------

Note: This phase can only begin after Cobalt is acquired/processed; unless other means of finding/acquiring metal grids is available.

- Production 
-- Assembler, Refinery, Large Cargo Grids
-- Equipment: Enhanced Drill, Enhanced Grinder, Enhanced Welder
- Build
-- Assembler
-- Refinery
-- Large Cargo Container
