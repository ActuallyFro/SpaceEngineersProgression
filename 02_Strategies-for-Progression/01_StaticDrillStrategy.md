Static Drill Strategy
=====================

The detailed phases provide a starting strategy for a new game, or new base, in Space Engineers.
It is designed to incorporate unlocking the basic blocks and progression of the game.
This strategy is uses a Static Drilling rig setup in Phases.
Each phase addresses Production, Building, Progression, and Tasks.

Phase I - Getting Basic Supplies Building 
-----------------------------------------

- Production (Survival Kit) (i.e., start producing the parts needed for blocks)
-- Medium Cargo Container 
-- Add Wind Turbine
-- Add Basic Assembler
-- 1K Gravel
- Building
-- Attach Medium Cargo to the Starter Ship's Survival Kit
--- Advanced tactic: drill immediately under the edge of where the cargo will be placed
--- If the landing gear is off, then when filled with stone the ship will tilt down
--- This enables quicker drilling, and "looking up" to fill the cargo/Survial Kit 
-- Prepare a new base with a Large Grid setup
--- Place (ideally) 3x3 NON-WELDED base of Light Armor blocks
--- Build tower of at least 6 tall 1x1 light armor
---- Note that pillars should be 8 blocks apart
---- Or have 5 blocks, blade-to-blade, between pillars' Turbine blades
---- Create "Compass Spokes" (NSEW) blocks, and a final/top block
---- Build the single Wind Turbine on top (until Phase II)
--- Build Basic Assembler 
- Progression (Grind, then repair IF blocks are on starter ship)
-- Landing Gear
-- H2/O2 Generator
--- (ADD temporary) Small Hydrogen Tank
---- To unlock H2 Thrusters; use an atmospheric thruster for parts
---- AVOID hooking it into the conveyor system, to save ice
-- Small Cargo Container
--- Conveyor
- Tasks
-- Start with filling the Survival Kit with stone, until you cannot -- then focus on adding the Medium Cargo
-- Mine STONE inbetween building/progression activities above
-- After medium cargo is built: fill it full (~10K)
--- Then again when it runs out
--- This "should" be enough to cover thru Phase II
-- Equipment: Grab H2 Tank from H2/O2 Generator IF jetpack is enabled, and O2 bottle IF in non-O2 start
-- Gather "Unknown Signal" air drops no greater than 1.5Km (on foot), 3.5(with jetpack)
--- run with drill equipped to detect ore
--- Motivation: upgraded tools can be found, and spare parts can be found and/or grinded
--- ENSURE stone is filled before departing!

Phase II - Merging Start Ship with Base
---------------------------------------

Note: ENSURE Survival Kit ONLY produces gravel from here on out!

- Production
-- Large Grid Small Cargo
--- MOVE the small tubes to the FRONT of production queue
-- Wind Turbine x2
-- Optional: Small Grid Exetension
--- Large Grid Advanced Rotor
--- Small Grid Conveyor Junction (NOT a small conveyor!)
--- Medium Cargo Container x2
-- Large Grid Battery
-- Interior Wall
-- 10K Gravel (Survival Kit)
- Building
-- Large Grid: add Small Cargo on to Basic Assembler
-- Optional: Advanced Rotor on to Small Cargo
--- REMOVE the large grid Rotor Head
--- Add a "Small Head" to the cargo (via control menus)
-- Attach Small Grid Conveyor Junction to Advanced Rotor
-- Interior Wall (to unlock lights, doors, ladders, and catwalks)
- Progression
-- Battery
--- Beacon
---- Antenna
-- Interior Wall (on Base)
--- Interior Light (on Starter Ship)
- Tasks
-- Grind down needed Thrusters (4 atmo or 1 h2) for Metal Grids (for Small Cargo)
-- Keep filling stone into small grid Survial Kit (~10K in med cargo)
-- Move all component Production to the base's Basic Assembler
--- Manually move over ingots from the Survival Kit to the Assembler until the Survial Kit is moved
-- Right BEFORE the battery is produced/built: move Survival Kit to Large Grid
-- Notes: 
--- Production of the 80 Power Cells takes a long time
--- The Large Grid Survival Kit only costs 29 more steel plates than the Small Grid
--- The Advanced Rotor, with a Small Head, allows all the parts from the Starter Ship to be built 1:1 on the base
---- This saves signigicant time and resources at the start of a new game for _some_ strategies/locations
---- HOWEVER, some games don't need/touch some blocks aside from unlocking progression

Phase III - Static Drill Setup
------------------------------

Note: Assume Large Grid blocks for building.

- Production
-- Basic Refinery x2 (to start Drill production of steel plates/etc.)
-- Drill x1
-- Conveyors x 8
-- Advanced Rotor -or- Hinge
-- Piston 
-- Drill x 7*
- Building
-- Extend conveyors out for static drilling
-- Recommend Horizontal Drilling IF no jetpacks
--- *Two main methods: (1) Piston + Hinge sweeping or (2) Piston + Rotor spinning 
---- Rotor spinning can be 7-wide
---- Hinge sweeping can be 7-wide/tall, but 5/6-wide is more stable
- Progression
-- You sould build the Basic Refinery and tear it down for the first Drill
--- Drills NEED a refinery to have built
--- The Survial Kit is better or equal to the Basic Refinery for Stone when on Large grid
--- (Opinion!) Expandable, rotor-spinning drills are better than piston-hinge sweeping drills
- Tasks
-- Ensure power needs are met (5-spoke Wind Turbines should be okay, more batteries _might_ be needed)
-- The Refinery _should_ be built when the first, large grid drill becomes operational
-- Try to re-use designs for static rig, but in the worst case: tear down and rebuild rigs 

Phase IV - Final Progression before Cobalt
-------------------------------------------

- Production
-- Small Grid Rocket Launcher
-- Small Grid Sound Block
-- Small Grid Door
-- Refinery (Less the Grids)
-- Assembler (Less the Grids)
-- Large Cargo Container (Less the Grids)
-- Associated materials for a 4-atmospheric thruster (small grid) ship
--- with Ore Detector and Antenna
- Building (On the Small Grid attached to the base)
-- Rocket Launcher
-- Sound Block
-- Door 
- Progression
-- Odds and ends for the tree, or missed items above
- Tasks
-- Expand drills and the rig
-- WATCH OUT for gravel build up (i.e., reccomend a Conveyor Sorter and Connector to eject waste gravel)
-- Make a very simple air ship for air-based ore detection
--- IF the atmospheric thrusters survived the fall and not used in the Small Cargo Container
--- Thrusters: down, forward, left, and right (additional breaking can be achieved through "leaning" back to break -- like a skate board)
--- Other considerations: Bottom Connector (to simplify transfer and battery charging) and a Medium Cargo container

Phase V - Post-Cobalt Processing Progression
-------

Note: This phase can only begin after Cobalt is acquired/processed; unless other means of finding/acquiring metal grids is available.

- Production 
-- Assembler, Refinery, Large Cargo Container(s)
-- Equipment: Enhanced Drill, Enhanced Grinder, Enhanced Welder (i.e., 2nd tier tools)
- Build
-- Assembler
-- Refinery
-- Large Cargo Container
- Progression
-- All cobalt-needed
- Tasks
-- Keep Drill Rig expanding/running
-- After silver is found: get second-tier upgraded tools
